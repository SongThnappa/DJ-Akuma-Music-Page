<h2>
BIO
</h2>
<p>
    Dj Akuma, real name Jessie Jones, started his career in music production in the 9th grade. He discovered a program called Fruity Loops. With it he started dabbling in sound creation. With no formal music training, he starting meshing sounds to create melodies and riffs with non traditional instruments such as symbols and bass lines. Eventually this curiosity matured into a more structured form, while still retaining the ability to "walk on the grass" as it were, disobeying any notion of rules when creating music.
